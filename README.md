Use this app to enter in your character and weapon data and find out your odds of rolling a better weapon as well as determine whether or not to take the weapon you rolled.

For the damage Totals (not the last line of DPS), you can make the values in thousands (as in 4500 instead of 4500000) and get the same results.
